if you wanna modularize routing to seperate folder/files entiry then we can use express router, which we can mount the route to this particular router using middleware in index.js

const bird = require("./routes/birds");

app.use("/birds",birds)

all routs starting with "/birds" will be redirected to the birdRoute file

you can also use middlewares in routes files which can be used in this particular routes file.


using 
res.status(200).json({messgae:"Ok"})

here res.status will return res object and on same project .json will be executed 
you have to know that we will be mocking you need to know this for some reason
